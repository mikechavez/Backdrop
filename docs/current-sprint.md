## Resolved This Sprint

### ✅ BUG-027: Remove Afternoon Scheduled Briefing
**Priority:** MEDIUM | **Severity:** LOW | **Resolved:** 2026-02-10
**Branch:** `fix/bug-027-remove-afternoon-scheduled-briefing` | **Commit:** 2661166

Celery Beat was running briefings 3x/day. Removed the 2 PM afternoon cron entry. Also fixed the manual afternoon trigger which was returning a 400 error — added `generate_afternoon_briefing()` to `briefing_agent.py` and updated the `/generate` endpoint to accept all three types.

**Files:** `beat_schedule.py`, `briefing_agent.py`, `api/v1/endpoints/briefing.py`
**Ticket:** `bug-027-remove-afternoon-scheduled-briefing.md`

### ✅ BUG-028: Website Always Shows the Same Briefing
**Priority:** HIGH | **Severity:** HIGH | **Resolved:** 2026-02-10
**Branch:** `fix/bug-027-remove-afternoon-scheduled-briefing` | **Commits:** 39ac7ab, 3bd4d8f

Frontend always displayed the same (oldest) briefing. Root cause: Motor's `find_one(..., sort=[...])` silently ignores the sort argument. Fixed by replacing with `find(filter).sort(...).limit(1)` in `get_latest_briefing()`.

**⚠️ Follow-up completed:** Audited all `find_one(..., sort=[...])` calls across `db/operations/` — **no other instances found**.

**Files:** `db/operations/briefing.py`
**Ticket:** `bug-028-website-always-shows-same-briefing.md`

### ✅ BUG-032: Duplicate Articles Under Signals
**Priority:** MEDIUM | **Severity:** MEDIUM | **Resolved:** 2026-02-23
**Branch:** `fix/bug-032-duplicate-articles` | **Commit:** `1c53e30`

API endpoint `/api/v1/signals/trending` was returning duplicate articles in the `recent_articles` field. Root cause: MongoDB aggregation pipeline in `get_recent_articles_for_entity()` lacked deduplication before limiting results. Fixed by adding `$group` stage to consolidate articles by URL before applying the 5-article limit, maintaining chronological order.

**Files:** `src/crypto_news_aggregator/api/v1/endpoints/signals.py`
**Ticket:** `bug-032-duplicate-articles-under-signals.md`

## Pending — High-Priority Candidates

### 1. FEATURE-037 Follow-on: Manual Briefing Flexibility (HIGH)
- BUG-027 resolved the broken afternoon trigger; this feature extends it further
- Add `force` parameter exposure in the admin UI (not just API)
- Consider time-based auto-detection of briefing type when `type` is omitted
- Implement afternoon briefing type coverage in `_calculate_next_briefing_time()` (currently skips afternoon in the "next briefing" countdown)

### 2. Motor `find_one` Sort Audit (MEDIUM)
- BUG-028 revealed a Motor footgun that could affect other queries
- Audit all `find_one(..., sort=[...])` calls across `db/operations/`
- Replace any found with the correct `find().sort().limit(1)` pattern

### 3. Performance Optimization (MEDIUM)
- Query tuning based on documented data model trade-offs
- Leverage insights from `50-data-model.md` (batch vs. parallel findings)

### 4. Frontend Enhancements (MEDIUM)
- New UI features enabled by stable documentation
- Leverage FEATURE-035 (recommended reading links) foundation
